<h1>The Best Movies According to Brendan</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Fired Up</h3>
<p>While at its core, Fired Up is a raunchy teen comedy without a super memorable cast, this movie never fails to put a smile on my face.</p>

<h3>Tick Tick Boom</h3>
<p>I'm not a big fan of musicals, but Tick Tick Boom features an emotional performance from Andrew Garfield and left me feeling melancholic and hopeful despite the movie's sometimes somber tone.</p>

<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>My favorite comic book movie to date, featuring a great take on Bruce Wayne by Robert Pattinson</p>
